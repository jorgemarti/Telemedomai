## Abstract
Development in Java language of a telemedicine system for remote assistance of patients by doctors and specialists, by the use of two different programs in a client-server scheme.

## Installation

If you want to run the projetc I recommend you to load both client and server applications as a Netbeans project. Eclipse might work as well but I didn't tested it.

The project's documentation at the moment is only given in Spainsh at the thesis report, which can be found at repository.
English translation of the functional parts will be available soon at the repository's wiki.

Thank you for your interest,
